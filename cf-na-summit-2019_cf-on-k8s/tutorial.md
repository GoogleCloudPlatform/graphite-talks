## Introduction

This tutorial will walk you through installing a Cloud Foundry platform solely on GKE.
All necessary infrastructure will also be created.

## Prerequisites

Cloud foundry will be deployed as a subdomain under a given root domain.
Ensure that you have:

- created a GCP DNS Zone for the root zone
- configured the GCP DNS Zone with a registered domain.

## Select a project

Choose the project you want to use with the rest of this tutorial.

## Deploy a Source Repository

This tutorial uses GitOps best practices to maintain the state of your Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes cluster.
The current directory contains the Terraform config and state files, which should always be maintained in a Git repository.

Run the following command to deploy a new repository from the current directory:

```
gcloud source repos create cf-on-k8s \
&& git config --global credential.https://source.developers.google.com.helper gcloud.sh \
&& git init \
&& git remote add google https://source.developers.google.com/p/graphite-test-eirini/r/test
&& git add -A \
&& git commit -m "Initial commit" \
&& git push --set-upstream google master
```

## Installation

First, fill out the `terraform.tfvalues` configuration.
Afterwards, initialize Terraform:

    terraform init

Now execute the Terraform plan:

    terraform apply -var project_id={{project-id}}

This should take about 30 minutes to complete. Take a â˜• break!

## Login to CF

Your CF installation has been created! Execute the following command to log in:

    cf login --skip-ssl-verify -a $(terraform output cf_api_endpoint) -u admin -p $(terraform output cf_admin_password)

## Deploy an example application

Let's deploy a Hello World application to the Cloud Foundry.
Use the cf CLI:

```
cf create-space demo \
&& cf tagert -s demo \
&& cf push
```

## Optional Cleanup

Terraform can be used to completely wipe the environment. Skip this step if you would like to keep your environment.

```terraform destroy -auto-approve```
